## Modupeola_Fagbenro_Nlp_Individual_Project - For News Article Generation Using LSTM model 



### Natural Language Processing Individual Project Contributions - News Article Generation Using LSTM Model 

### Overview:
This project implements a deep learning -neural network based model for generating news article text using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. 
Model is built from scratch and trained on a diverse dataset of news articles to generate coherent and contextually relevant content.

 
### Project Objectives

- Develop from scratch deep learning- neural network LSTM model for news article generation using PYTORCH 
- Train the model on a comprehensive news dataset from various source up till 5 data news sources 
- Generate high-quality, coherent news articles
- Evaluate and optimize model performance
- Future Work/ Post-training analysis
